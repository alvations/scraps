The quiet town has nothing going on, absolutely nothing. There is a certain tranquility that comes with the nothingness but the silence for tonight is rather deafening. But I know I am safe, at least I feel I am, tugging under my bathrobe next to the artificial fireplace that is in fact a radiator with an LED display of flickering flames. I sat as Nora Jones question herself about not calling. In today's language, it's more like "Don't know why I didn't emoji".

The very fact of nothingness screams of an escape from reality, it's not that I do not have that tonne of work that every academic has, it's just that for tonight, I choose to embrace the nothingness at the influence of Nectar Leffe. I don't suppose the Belgique beverage has much influence though.The post-modern french-sounding jazz starts to creep me out amidst the silence. The fidgety sets in, it's time for the next Flemish adventure, Duvel; a sweet hint of herb enriched by the bitter hoppiness.

"BIANG, BIANG, BIANG," it sounds like it's from the opposite street.

"Ahhhh ahhhh.," screams starts to fill the street.

"I cannot hide my powers any more," I thought, "There must be yet another shooting spree."

I feel so remorseful the last time I tried to restrain myself from saving the others. I could not believe how I stooped so low as to pretend to be shot in order to survive through today. Some people says that the PTSD is causing my alcoholism, my immediate response was to remind them how much I drink before the last incident.

"I cannot hide anymore," I thought out loud, "So what if the Feds know that I am not normal."

Like a flashing family guy cut-away, I hear Lynda saying, "They're going to give you the key to the city, then lock you up in some SHIELD facilities to tag you and then start to cut you up into pieces to extract/use your powers."

The reflexive response to Lynda has always been a sigh, followed by heading to the kitchen to reach out to my bourbon. Alright at this point, I must confess it's a coping mechanism but it's by no means an "addiction" nor am I "losing control". I don't need a 12 steps program nor do I need to find a professional to talk about last week's incident.

"I must go and help them. If any more blood is shed around me with me doing nothing, I would rather be shot and not live in retrospective remorse," thought bubbles in my head.

I tighten my bathrobe, slip on my cosy plush slippers, pick up my keys and head towards the door. Just when the door knob clicks, "Jack, where are you going?" say Lynda.

"It's just another prank the kids are playing," Lynda continues, "It's not the first time this week, they shoot firecrackers to scare the heck of the old people shuffling down the street towards the supermarket"

"And even if you walk out there, you can't do anything! Yes, you can control the TV without the remote, you can get the computers to generate Bitcoins faster than other people. Oh heck, someday you might be able to get the ATM to spit out cash," there goes the rambling from Lynda,

"But no matter what kind of technopathic powers you have you're not going to stop a real human with a mechanical rifle. It's not like there's a computer chip in gun or something," she continues the babbling,

"What do you call that thing? Neurotic Web or something Artificial Intelligence, that thing that makes Google self driving car and that Siri thing from Apple"

Whenever she regurgitates what I tell her about technology, it's like that Chinese whisper game, it gets all jibberish and much like machine translation, half the time, at least half of what Google translate output is nonsense.

She hasn't seen the manifestation of the new level of technopathy I have acquired. I do regret that I tried to control that drone to hit innocent target but I guess that's what they call collateral damage. Without it, I do not truly know the extent of my powers. The thought of the drone hitting the innocent, the memory of the news explaining the situation as a hacker group creating havoc with US diplomatic relations makes me jittery. I took out the last bottle of pocket size Jagermeister in my bathrobe.

"BIANG, BIANG, BIANG, BIANG," more explosive sounds echo the street.

"I must go, no matter what, it is my calling," I gurgle a mouth-full of jager and open the door.

As I walk out the yard, "Jack, what the ****, the heating is going to escape if you leave the door open!" says Lynda.

Oh, it is just firecrackers. My paranoia is unnecessary but I am proud of myself, taking the step out the door, my first since the last week. Until the next time, for now, my powers should be kept within the confines of mining more Bitcoins...

Freedom lies in the choices we make more than the choices we didn't or can't. If my freedom impedes that of another, then it is mere gratification not true freedom.
