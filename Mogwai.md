The mogwai trapped within me demands release. 
Like fetal movement, the mogwai nudges my heart. Thud, thud, thud...

The mogwai couldn't grasp what's outside of me, 
thus it steals my inner being. Bit by bit by bit...

Almost empty, i made a pact with the mogwai. 
Give him freedom and he returns my life. yet i know, he lies. 

i chose the mogwai over my life. why, why, why...
