We talked until two and then she said, "It's time for bed"

The awkward silence lasted for a minute before she said, "Are you really going to sleep on the floor?"

I responded with silence. "Here's a cushion to use as a pillow," she said, throwing the satin red sofa cushion at me.

I looked out the window at the glistening snow reflecting the waning gibbous moonlight.

"Perhaps I should not ask further. Let him come to me instead," she thought out loud whispering to herself.

"You know that I heard what you just said, right?" I said.

If only, I had left earlier and escaped the thick snow. The snowplow will not come until daybreak at 5.15am. In retrospect, possibly the most regretful 3 hours 15 mins spent.

"I have to work tomorrow morning," she said, laughing.

"But I don't," I answered.

Turning on the lights, she headed to the kitchen. I sat up on the rug and she brought in two glasses and a bottle of Shiraz.

"Ah-Or-Ce," she said with her fake french accent, "CÃ´tes du Rhone Villages Chateau Rochecolombe".

"Fancy," I replied.

"2013, le tres best," persisting the obnoxious french accent.

The prescriptivist in me wanted badly to correct her, 'le meilleur du meilleur'. I withheld.

Passing me one of the half filled glass, she said "Salut! To me working tomorrow and you not."

"Prost!" I replied looking into her eyes. Yet I can't seem to see through those glasses of her.

Taking a gulp, I noticed that the taste of the wine without food is impeccable, she must had left to breathed for a while.

She took a slight sip, brought the glass down to the chest level, swirling, dropping the French facade, she said, "So besser?"

Switching to the Saarlandische dialect, taking a large sip of the wine, she repeated "Und?"

"Danke schoen," I replied, "It has been long since I have had a home-cooked dinner and a nice glass of red."

"Ach so, bin ich nur dein Butler?" she replied defensively, her blush was showing. She has never been one that can hold her liquor.

She poured a second glass for herself and took another long sip.

"Answer me!" she demanded, "Bin ich nur dein Butler? Master Bruce?"

She stood up from the bed, placed the glass on the nightstand, "Anworte mir!"

"N," I haven't even completed the syllable.

"Hosenscheisser! I know you still like me." she said.

"You had too much. You have to work tomorrow, go to sleep. I have to go too," I replied, knowing well that I'll end up shivering in the car.

"Es ist mir doch scheissegal!" she continued the verbal abuse.

"Heidi, schlafen! Schlaf gut. I'm going home." I said.

Just when I reached the door, the sobbing starts. She started mumbling in German. With my limited German and her crying, I understood nothing. I had to walk back to the bed.

"You don't love me anymore," she said crying.

"Heidi, we have been through this," I said, taking the glass of wine away from her. She started to drink directly from the bottle.

Sighing, I picked up my glass and finished it. I knew what was going to happen. It's the fifth time since we broke up in February. Still sobbing, she pouted and looked at me with those dreamy eyes again.

And when I awoke, I was alone, she left for work. The bird has flown.
