We talked until two and then she said, "It's time for bed."

There was an awkward silence for a minute before she said, "Are you really going to sleep on the floor?"

I responded with silence. "Here's a cushion to use as a pillow," she said, throwing the satin red sofa cushion at me.

I looked out the window at the glistening snow, reflecting the waning gibbous moonlight.

"Perhaps I should stop asking. Let him come to me instead," she whispered out loud to herself.

"You know that I heard what you just said, right?" I said.

If only I had left earlier and escaped the deep snow. The snowplow wouldn’t come until daybreak at 5.15am. In retrospect, this would possibly be the most regretful 3 hours 15 mins I ever spent.

"I have to work tomorrow morning," she said, laughing.

"But I don't," I answered.

Turning on the lights, she headed to the kitchen. I sat up on the rug and she brought in two glasses and a bottle of Shiraz.

"Ah-Or-Ce," she said with her fake french accent, "Côtes du Rhône Villages Château Rochecolombe".

"Fancy," I replied dryly.

"2013, le tres best," she added, persisting with that obnoxious French accent.

The grammarian in me wanted badly to correct her: “le meilleur du meilleur.” But I refrained from doing so.

Passing me a half-filled glass, she said "Salut! To me working tomorrow and you not."

"Prost!" I replied, looking into her eyes. Yet I can't seem to see through those glasses of hers.

Taking a gulp, I noticed that the taste of the wine without food is impeccable; she must had left it to breathe for a while.

She took a slight sip, then brought the glass down to chest level, swirling it gently. She dropped the French facade and said, "So besser?" She then switched to the Saarlandische dialect and took another, larger sip of the wine, repeating, "Und?"

"Danke schoen," I replied, "It’s been a long time since I’ve had a home-cooked dinner and a nice glass of red."

"Ach so, bin ich nur dein Butler?" she replied defensively, her face flushed. She could never hold her liquor.

Finishing her wine, she poured a second glass for herself and took another long sip.

"Answer me!" she demanded. "Bin ich nur dein Butler? Master Bruce?"

She stood up from the bed and placed the glass on the nightstand. "Anworte mir!"

I didn’t even complete a single syllable before she interrupted me. "Hosenscheisser! I know you still like me,” she said.

"You’ve had too much. You have to work tomorrow, go to bed. I should get going," I replied, knowing well that I'll end up shivering in the car. Right now, however, that seems the preferable option.

"Es ist mir doch scheissegal!" she snapped at me.

"Heidi, schlafen! Schlaf gut. I'm going home," I said firmly.

Just when I reached the door, the sobbing started. She began mumbling in German. Between my limited German and her crying, I understood nothing. I had no choice but to walk back to the bed.

"You don't love me anymore," she hiccuped.

"Heidi, we have been through this," I said, gently taking the glass of wine away from her. She started to drink directly from the bottle.

Sighing, I picked up my glass and finished it. I knew what was going to happen next. It was the fifth time since we broke up in February. Still sobbing, she pouted and looked at me with those dreamy eyes again.

And when I awoke, I was alone; she’d left for work. The bird had flown.
