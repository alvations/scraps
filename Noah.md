Eureka, my math proved to be correct. I will no longer be ridiculed by my neighbors as the modern day Noah, building a zoo in an ark awaiting a flood. I had checked the math a gazillion times and it gave the same result; the earth is revolving on an inclined plane wrapped helically around its axis, the sun. 

Each revolution around the orbit brought us closer to the sun. That explains the immutable global warming, all the fuss about going meatless to save the environment is plain balderbash. I ran the computer simulation with the hypothesized polytropes and re-checked my hyperparameters on the Lambda-CDM model. They checked out. Yes, our earth is doomed to collide with the sun at a certain point. Yes, the mercury will soar beyond the melting point on our thermometers. 

Yes, global warming is certainly a threat to humanity. But it is not for another 107 years, 107 years 5 months 9 days 3 hours 58 minutes and 12 secs to be exact. I know I won't live to see the day. I pressed the delete button and demagnetize the harddisk. I may had lost a noble prize in physics but I had saved humanity from the bleak through of the inevitable end.
