"I have had enough," those were the exact words that started the chain of events that led to the situation today. There was a need to rise against this fallacious belief that everyone who strives hard enough will result in rags to riches. The world was suffering from a chaotic of bottomless debts and immense wealth. The bankers were never starving in the cold winter in times of 'financial crisis'. In fact, they walked out of the crisis from millionaires to billionaires, betting against the system and for the fall to happen, formulating deceitful derivatives to lure investors into their bubble they've created out of binary soap. I had no choice, we had no choice but to revolt against the nefarious world system. I never intended for it to end this way.

Like all great things in history, it started with an idea. I was at the brink of tipsy when I started to tattle my plans to James. I remembered the looks on his face, fascinated.

"Yeah, you're right. It's time we stand up against this load of bull and stop dumping money at the cursed bank," James replied in that Essex accent, pouted lips and nasally.

I continued, "We should do it tomorrow, yeah?"

"Yeah," James said, exaggerating the vowel.

I woke the next morning swiping the nightstand for an aspirin as I laid on the bed. "Get up now, people are waiting for you," Jame shouting at my door.

"How did you get in?" I said.

"Bloody hell! You just had 2 pints of ale and you couldn't remember what happened?" James still shouting. "Okay now, go wash up and get ready for your speech."

"What speech?" I mumbled, still lying on the bed.

"The bloody revolution of yours, of course. You said, 'We should gather all these in-debt people and start crushing the banks with some strategic actions. And then you told me about the plan to erase our debts. You better not bloody forget the plan you told me last night. We're counting on you. Go now, wash up, we're gonna be late," James said.

My neural memory started recovering while I washed my face. Yes, the plan to overthrow the regime of financial overlords. I must have as James to garner the people to inaugarate the revolution. I didn't think that it would really happen, at least, I didn't think that it would happen that soon.

James had always been a wizard on the internet, a white hat by day, a grey hat by night. No one knew, he was the secret Satoshi who liberated us with the widely used crypto currency today, Bitcoin. It was only after his death that we had no choice but to revere him with the laurels of today's Che Guevara. Without him, we would not be here today. The night he heard my plans he activated his hacker friends and organized the revolution speech in hours.

I stood in front of the mirror rehearsing my opening, "'Ladies and gentlemen', too formal. 'Hello', too relaxed. 'Weclome', what?". After several more attempts, I thought, "Screw the opening, I should just get on with the speech and the plan".

"Bloody hell, what's taking you so long to primp yourself?" James banging on the door.

We rushed to the car and parked near subway tunnel near the Esplanade station.

"Where's the location? Why are there jumbotron TV all around the Esplanade? Are we planning to crash someone's party and give our speech?" I asked James.

"No," James extending the back vowel, "This is it, your speech. Toad called me in the morning and asked for funds for the jumbotrons because the subway tunnel is packed and people waiting outside and along the river for your speech"

"WHAT?!" that was the only word I could muster at that point in time.

We had a entourage with those fancy earpieces dressed in black suits escorting me towards a platform made of beer crates. I stood on the crates, clutching the wireless mic, looking down at the mass of clapping people that filled up the space up to the escalators, frozen. Even the security staff of the Esplanade building were nodding and clapping.

"Go on, give your bloody speech," James nudged me from the side.

I gave the mic a tap. The applause ceased. A surge of adrenaline filled my mind. It was like I was possess but I was conscious, saying,

"We are the people oppressed by the elites of this world today? They are the ones hiding in their mansion and pitying us with the meager minimum wage while expecting us to clean up their mess, secure their premises, run their errands and live at their back and calls." the crowd roars as I had a short pause.

The roars abated as I continued, "How is it that these people sit and make phone calls and they earn a bucket load of cash while we who slogged our sweat and blood barely afford to pay for our loan repayments? Why should we endure this slavery to an imbalanced state of economy?"

Sirens sounded from outside the subway, "This is the police, all of you are under arrest on the charge of illegal gathering and ..." A ruckus seemed to form outside.

I concluded the speech briefly and said, "Now is the time we stand up against them. Now is the time we change the system and build a new world order. Now is the time, our revolution starts. Now is the time for our world to evolve." I raised my hand and stuck three fingers side ways forming the E letter. The crowd clamors and clap, while chanting, 'Evolve, Evolve, Evolve, ..."

"Ting," tear gas started to roll into the subway. James pulled me down the crates and the entourage pathed the way to James car parked a street away. Meanwhile the crowd broke into a riot, fight ing against the batons and shields.

We were quiet in the car as James drove towards his loft. I was thrilled by the crowd's response to the call to arms. I knew that while driving, James was already mentally planning the strategic attacks that I spoke about the night before. His eyes were towards the windscreen but his taping fingers on the steer gave it away.

The delete of the bank servers, the vaults reclamation, the bitcoin economy, the debtless society, all that would not had happened if not for James Charles Lee. We fought for the peace and equality we have today. Blood was shed in the evolution civil wars but without it Singaporeans would not live in the parity we have today. Without the evolution war, the distinction between income classes and ordinal world countries would still exist. E - evolve towards equality.
