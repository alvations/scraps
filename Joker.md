The darkness within me manifests itself in places that I've never imagined. I grinned as I sneered at the dead body lying motionless beside me. The puddle of blood brûléed after the platelets curdles the crimson red fluid flowing from broken skull. I too stood motionless as flashbacks of the fight plays like a broken record. “Ahhhh, Noooo, Please stop. Ahhhh, Noooo, Please stop. Ahhhh, Noooo, Please stop…” I tightened my grip on that ice cold metallic bat, I wonder why would anyone bat a ball when batting a brain is way more euphoric than a ball. The face of the victim frozen at the puzzled look, he must be thinking, or was thinking “Why me? I don’t even know you? Who sent you?” I sniggered as I try to answer him “Why so serious? You were just at the wrong place at the wrong time. You walked past me when I have a bat.”
 
The body started to wriggle, so he is not dead. That’s strange, and I don’t like strange things. I believe whatever that doesn’t kill you, makes you stranger. I tilted my head like how a cock would when it is befuddled, then the head motion ends with a hard swing into loud crackle at the neck. The sound resonates from the body, “aaa…” I reinstate my disliking, I don’t like strange things that make noise. The bat swang towards the head since that was where the sound was coming from. Then the bat turn to target the hand since it was wriggling. Once again, motionless. I like it that way.
The sound of police sirens, oh what pleasure that brought me. Like a fan who saw his idol from afar, I looked down the building and start waving at them frantically.
 
Great, to join the party is a police chopper and the megaphone went “Drop your weapon and put your hands above your head!” No one asks me to drop my precious, my precious metallic stick. I lifted that dead body and dragged it towards the edge of the building.
 
“Shut your mouth or I’ll drop this flesh meat down the building,” I said.
 
“Let him go!” from the megaphone.
 
“1) I told you to shut up. 2) Very poor choice of words” I replied as I let go of the bloody man down the 40 storey building. “Thud!” the sound of flatten and splattered meat.
