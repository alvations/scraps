She sat down at the park bench looking at the throng of people swiping away the pokeballs towards the imaginary pixels augmented by the video camera while their smartphones emited heat beyond what it should. The extend to which people go to collecting binary bits that presented in whimsical monsters that can somehow be zapped into a ball like container; power banks, extra batteries, back-burner phones. If someone were to travel forward in time from the 90s, they would have thought this is a yet another bookies' den collecting bets from compulsive gamblers, doubling down each time they lose.

And there she sat, also swiping the phone away anticipating a new message in her whatsapp.

"Are you Reikolee?" said one of the pokemon addict.

"No," Ada replied

"Look, you're wearing the same color," the pokeguy showed Ada the avatar wearing a black leggings and dark blue shirt with black sleeves, coincidentally doning pink long hair.

"NO," Ada replied with heighten irritation.

"Do I know you from somewhere else?" the pokeguy continued the pestering.

Ada stood up and walked away, thinking, "What the heck is wrong with this Niantic? Why must they put a stupid gym at the mini-park in front of my house?"

She looked around and all she could visualized was the dragon playground looking like a piece of shit and dung beetles flocking to this iconic landmark that represents the childhood of many.

"Scheisse," she mumbled as she walked down the stairwell towards the main road. One of the few German word she picked up from her previous partner. Seemingly, she had forgotten much about Lizzy but she still wears the choker that Lizzy gave. Jean being Jean has never questioned about the choker too.

"Scyther at the main road!" shouted a passby. The fecalvoires swarmed towards Ada's direction.

"Dummkopfen," she mumbled unconsciously as her fingers fiddled with the pendant on the choker.
