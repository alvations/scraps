The madness was turning into hysteria. The constant swiping down of the screen in the hope that an updated message would appear. Ada stared blankly at the screen while seeing the colored wheel spun round and round. Intuitively, she knew that Jean heard the voice mail but she choose to think that the missed called is nothing but her imaginary figment. Still the fact remained, someone used Jean's phone to dial her number.

She paced around the living room, swiping the phone in vain. She made calls to Jean and they ended up in the same message, "The mobile number you have just called is not available". She started to send short-fire messages.

"Jean, I miss you."

"Where are you now?"

"Why don't you answer my call?"

"Are you seeing these messages"

"I am sad"

"Pick up the phone NOW!"

"I hate you, why did you leave me?"

She turned from longing to depression to anger. Yet there was still no response after 30 mins. The expectation of a modern generation where instant is the norm; any delayed response would be thought as otherwise.

The phone rang, "Ada," said a familiar voice...

"Ada," said Jean, followed by a full 30 seconds of silence. She knew not the power of silence but instinctively she was using it to exert a taint of fear to the person on the other side of the phone.

"Ada," she repeated, "I am sorry."

"What do you mean 'you are sorry'? It is not a matter that can be resolve by a verbal apology. You left without saying much and I haven't seen you in three weeks," said Ada angrily over the phone, "Where are you now? Are you still in Singapore? What are you doing now? You better..."

And before Ada could finish the sentence, Jean hanged up the phone and switched it off.

"... not hang up on me," says Ada after the phone hung.

Jean headed to the kitchen to pick up the chilled whiskey from the fridge, nothing fancy but a good bottle of single-barreled gentlemen Jack. She poured a glass on the rocks and considered using the whiskey stones in the fridge. She hesitated and skipped the stones. In her mind, the stones were superfluous, one of the senseless gift that Ada gave her last Christmas. Ada thought that Jean likes her whiskey chilled but she doesn't understand that it is the melting ice that softens the blow of the whiskey alcoholic hit on the neurons. (Somewhat like regression on the activation function in a neural net - note to self, maybe this line should be removed from this story... )

In fact, Ada has no idea how whiskey stones work. Jean only used it once when Ada first gave her. She pretended that she liked the whiskey stones and used it from the box unfrozen.

Jean turned on the TV and see the miasma of news on the upcoming USA elections owned by a mega-egoistic reality TV star. She drifted into the state of nothingness on the rocks in her hand, turning the newscasters into white noise.
She said to herself, "If only I have never met her."
