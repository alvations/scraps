She looked at the loot of her retail therapy and the initial joy her new Christian Louboutin pumps and Hugo Boss pants suit dissipated as she was on her way back to the empty apartment where her mind will begin to run wild with anxiety.

Jean has minimum passion for her paralegal job but she excels in the heap of paper-trawling. In fact, she excels in everything, graduated magna cum laude in high school as a triple-science (biology, chemistry, physics) track student and egregia cum laude in her law degree from Brown University.

Returning home, now she is a paralegal in Lee and Tan LLP, a rising practice with high profile cases, the person who stole Sarin from GSK at Tuas, the alleged politician who won a by-election and was put to jail thereafter on counts of sedation against the government, the "town council against a carton of egg" corruption case where the deinujla town council was accused of corruption when accepting a carton of egg from one of resident. All these high profile cases, handled by Jean and her mentor, Mr Tan Joo Boon, an ex-convict who went against all odds to pass the bar exam.

Another lady pushing the grocery trolley entered and pressed the button to the 4th storey. Jean entered the lift as the other lady walked towards the back of the lift. Jean pressed the 9th and they did the awkward elevator shuffle where people re-position themselves in the order of their anticipated exit. She looked at Jean's paper bags gleaming with envy. Jean was unconcerned, distracted by the torrent of feelings she was feeling within.

The lift beeped as the door opened on the 4th, off went the lady. Jean stood thoughtful as the door closed upon the time limit, beeping. She held her mobile phone swiping to wake it, another missed call from Ada, this time with a voice message.

She played it, "Jean, it's not funny anymore. I know you're listening to this voicemail. Please call back! [Sniffles]"

Jean remained emotionless. If it was 5 years ago, she would have broke into tears and pushed the green call-back icon immediately. But with her legal experience, she was taught to remain calm in all circumstances, she played it again. As though hoping that the message in the voicemail would change.

"Jean, it's not funny anymore. I know you're listening to this voicemail. Please call back! [Sniffles]," the same message.

She did it again and the lift started beeping at the 9th storey. Distracted, her analytical mind slipped and the emotions took over for a moment as she punched the call-back icon.

As she stepped out of the lift, it was as though her logical mind got back and she cancelled the call and turned it off. Frantically looking for her keys, she dropped it twice as she opened the gate and the main door. Slamming the door shut, she kicked off her Onizuka shoes, she sat on the couch, weeping in the fetal position. It was one of the few time she cried in recent years. It was also the first time she cried since she left Ada.

"It is for the better, it is for the better," she repeated out loud to herself, "She deserves better".

----

The melancholy built up as she starts ignoring it. The torrent of emotions all pent up within, waiting for a trigger.

She read and re-read the messages again and again, hoping to see a new reply for her. Nothing. It had been a week since they lost contact and the last words she left were, "I will miss you". The eventual modal verb kept the linguist within thinking. At least that the thousands spent on the linguistic major was worth something.

The phone held on her hand vibrated. With excitement, she opened the flap to find yet another spam email. Frustrated, she sat on the park bench and sent another message to the blackhole number, knowing that there won't be a reply but hoping to receive one. This time, it's a voice message.

"Jean, it's not funny anymore. I know you're listening to this voicemail. Please call back! [Sniffles]" She stopped the recording and sent the message before breaking into tears.

And out comes a hand with a Burberry checkered handkerchief, the same design as what Jean had. "Here, wipe it off," the voice said as the silhouette walked away, "Keep the handkerchief, please take care."

It's not Jean, at least it didn't sound like her. The phone vibrated once again. Puzzle at the coincidence, she stared blankly into the air before opening the phone flap. At an instance, the vibration ceased.

A missed call from Jean's number...


The madness was turning into hysteria. The constant swiping down of the screen in the hope that an updated message would appear. Ada stared blankly at the screen while seeing the colored wheel spun round and round. Intuitively, she knew that Jean heard the voice mail but she choose to think that the missed called is nothing but her imaginary figment. Still the fact remained, someone used Jean's phone to dial her number.

She paced around the living room, swiping the phone in vain. She made calls to Jean and they ended up in the same message, "The mobile number you have just called is not available". She started to send short-fire messages.

"Jean, I miss you."

"Where are you now?"

"Why don't you answer my call?"

"Are you seeing these messages"

"I am sad"

"Pick up the phone NOW!"

"I hate you, why did you leave me?"

She turned from longing to depression to anger. Yet there was still no response after 30 mins. The expectation of a modern generation where instant is the norm; any delayed response would be thought as otherwise.

The phone rang, "Ada," said a familiar voice...

"Ada," said Jean, followed by a full 30 seconds of silence. She knew not the power of silence but instinctively she was using it to exert a taint of fear to the person on the other side of the phone.

"Ada," she repeated, "I am sorry."

"What do you mean 'you are sorry'? It is not a matter that can be resolve by a verbal apology. You left without saying much and I haven't seen you in three weeks," said Ada angrily over the phone, "Where are you now? Are you still in Singapore? What are you doing now? You better..."

And before Ada could finish the sentence, Jean hanged up the phone and switched it off.

"... not hang up on me," says Ada after the phone hung.

Jean headed to the kitchen to pick up the chilled whiskey from the fridge, nothing fancy but a good bottle of single-barreled gentlemen Jack. She poured a glass on the rocks and considered using the whiskey stones in the fridge. She hesitated and skipped the stones. In her mind, the stones were superfluous, one of the senseless gift that Ada gave her last Christmas. Ada thought that Jean likes her whiskey chilled but she doesn't understand that it is the melting ice that softens the blow of the whiskey alcoholic hit on the neurons. (Somewhat like regression on the activation function in a neural net - note to self, maybe this line should be removed from this story... )

In fact, Ada has no idea how whiskey stones work. Jean only used it once when Ada first gave her. She pretended that she liked the whiskey stones and used it from the box unfrozen.

Jean turned on the TV and see the miasma of news on the upcoming USA elections owned by a mega-egoistic reality TV star. She drifted into the state of nothingness on the rocks in her hand, turning the newscasters into white noise.
She said to herself, "If only I have never met her."
