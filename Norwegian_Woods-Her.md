We talked until two, "It's time for bed," I said.

And silence was the best response he gave. Breaking the silence, "Are you really going to sleep on the floor?"

He continued with his muted strike. Wanting a response, I threw my hugging cushion at him, "Here's a cushion to use as a pillow."

He sat starring blankly out of the window, the moonlight glistening on his left profile; the charming thick brows with that black spikey hair of his. I hate that 90s rocker look of his. In his sweatpants, hoodie and that silly t-shirt with the creepy Kelloggs Tiger and the caption saying, "Why so cereals?".

"Perhaps I should not ask further. Let him come to me instead," I thought out loud, desperately trying to get him out of that gargoyle pose. It felt like he would start howling to the half-moon if I don't stop him.

"You know that I heard what you just said, right?" he said. At last, with his face turned away from that eerie pose. I gave a light pat on the right side of the bed.

"I have to work tomorrow morning," I said, pretending that it's something funny.

"But I don't," he answered.

Turning on the lights, I put on my duck face before turning away from him towards the kitchen. Heading back, I saw him sitting up on the rug.

"Ah-Or-Ce," I said with the french accent I've picked up from selling crepes at Crêperie Saarbrücken. I still remembered once a Mademoiselle was literally pantomiming and grunting to ask for more bacons in the Flammekuchen.

"Côtes du Rhone Villages Chateau Rochecolombe," I continued with the Truman show like product placement.

"Fancy," he replied. As much as I hate his uncouth knowledge of wine, I fall for that silliness and child like innocence.

"2013, le tres best," continuing my French acting. He always falls for that; a little french accent and some light Alizée swaying as I poured the wine.

Naturally, he picked up the glass as I passed it to him. "Salut! To me working tomorrow and you not," I toasted.

"Prost!" he replied, not forgetting the Germans' fear of no eye contact during a toast. He squinted.

"So besser?" I said, "Und?"

"Danke schoen," he replied. His German accent is flawless but the charade stops whenever he starts using English words with a Germanic accent. At that point, he sounds like some spoilt Dutch brat who was sent to an English boarding school.

"It has been long since I have had a home-cooked dinner and a nice glass of red," he said.

I felt the flush on my cheeks. I blurted out of some sort of emotions, "Ach so, bin ich nur dein Butler?" Not knowing why I said what I said. I finished the wine in the glass and poured a second.

'Was I joking?' I thought in my head, 'Or am I just somewhat angry that he's just here for the food? Wouldn't I at least be a friend that he cares about?'

I took another shot at the wine, "Answer me!" I said puff my face, "Bin ich nur dein Butler? Master Bruce?"

Possibly, it was the alcohol talking but I think it was the intoxication that empowered me to stand up to him and get an answer from him, "Anworte mir!" I don't get him; being hot and cold towards me.

I think he was going to say something but I have given him more than enough time to answer, "Hosenscheisser! I know you still like me."

"You had too much. You have to work tomorrow, go to sleep. I have to go too," he replied.

I was drunk but I was not drunk enough to forget that the thick snow was the reason why he's staying. And the fact that the snowplow would not come until 6am.

I hate it when he tries me like a dumb blond, I replied "Es ist mir doch scheissegal!"

"Heidi, schlafen! Schlaf gut. I'm going home." he said, leaving his glass on the nightstand, walking towards the door.

"Geh mir aus den Augen!" I shouted at the doorway as my eyes started pouring,

Drinking the salinated wine, "Du liebst mich nicht mehr. I hate you. Du dachtest früher, ich sei cute," I said, wiping my cheeks.

He came back. "You don't love me anymore," I said.

"Heidi, we have been through this," he said, taking my glass away from me, sitting on the bed. I picked up the bottle, soothing the cry. He drank the leftover wine from his glass and sighed lightly as though he was hiding it from me.

I put my arms around him. The endearing smell. Still snuffling, I pouted and looked at him.

And when I awoke, I was alone, he left. The bird has flown.
