We talked until two. "It's time for bed," I said.

And silence was the only response he gave. 

Eventually I broke the silence. "Are you really going to sleep on the floor?"

He continued with his mute rebellion. Wanting a response, I threw my hugging cushion at him. "Here's a cushion to use as a pillow."

He sat staring blankly out of the window, the moonlight glistening on his profile; the charming thick brows with that black spikey hair of his. I hate that 90s rocker look of his. His attire ws no better: sweatpants, hoodie, and that silly t-shirt with the creepy Kellogg’s tiger and a caption saying, "Why so cereals?"

"Perhaps I should stop asking. Let him come to me instead," I thought out loud, desperately trying to prompt him out of that gargoyle pose. It felt like he would start howling at the half-moon if I didn’t stop him.

"You know that I heard what you just said, right?" he said. At last, his face turned away from that eerie moonlit pose. I gave a light pat on the right side of the bed.

"I have to work tomorrow morning," I said with a lighthearted tone.

"But I don't," he answered.

Turning on the lights, I put on my duck face before turning away from him and heading towards the kitchen. Heading back, I saw him sitting up on the rug.

"Ah-Or-Ce," I said with the french accent I've picked up from selling crêpes at Crêperie Saarbrücken. I still remembered once a Mademoiselle was literally pantomiming and grunting, gesturing for more bacon in the Flammekuchen.

"Côtes du Rhône Villages Château Rochecolombe," I continued, with the Truman-show-like product placement.

"Fancy," he replied. As much as I hate his uncouth ignorance of wine, I still fall for that silliness and childlike innocence.

"2013, le très best," continuing my French acting. He usually falls for that; a little French accent and some light Alizée swaying as I poured the wine.

Naturally, he accepted the glass as I passed it to him. "Salut! To me working tomorrow and you not," I toasted.

"Prost!" he replied, not forgetting the Germans' insistence on eye contact during a toast. He squinted.

"So besser?" I said. "Und?"

"Danke schoen," he replied. His German accent is flawless, but the charade stops whenever he starts using English words with a Germanic accent. At that point, he sounds like a spoiled Dutch brat who was sent to an English boarding school.

"It’s been a long time since I’ve had a home-cooked dinner and a nice glass of red," he said.

I felt my cheeks burn. I blurted out emotionally, "Ach so, bin ich nur dein Butler?" I wasn’t sure why I said what I did. Still flushing, I quickly finished my wine and poured a second glass.

Was I joking? I thought in my head. Or am I really annoyed that he's just here for the food? Wouldn't I at least be a friend that he cares about?

I took another shot at the wine. "Answer me!" I said, puffing my cheeks. "Bin ich nur dein Butler? Master Bruce?"

Possibly, it was the alcohol talking but I think it was the intoxication that empowered me to stand up to him and get an answer from him. "Anworte mir!" I don't get him; he alternates between acting hot and cold towards me.

I think he was going to say something eventually, but I feel that I’ve given him more than enough time to answer. "Hosenscheisser! I know you still like me."

"You’ve had too much,” he said. “You have to work tomorrow; go to bed. I should get going.”

I was drunk, but I was not drunk enough to forget that the thick snow was the reason why he was staying. And the fact that the snowplow would not come until six tomorrow morning.

I hate it when he treats me like a dumb blonde. I snapped, "Es ist mir doch scheissegal!"

"Heidi, schlafen! Schlaf gut. I'm going home," he said, putting his glass on the nightstand and heading towards the door.

"Geh mir aus den Augen!" I shouted at the doorway as my eyes started streaming tears.

Gulping my wine, now salty with tears, I hissed, "Du liebst mich nicht mehr. I hate you. Du dachtest früher, ich sei cute," I said, wiping my cheeks.

He turned back. "You don't love me anymore," I repeated.

"Heidi, we have been through this," he said quietly, gently taking my glass away from me, sitting on the bed. I picked up the bottle, soothing myself. He drank the leftover wine from his glass and stifled a sigh.

I put my arms around him. What an endearing smell. Still snuffling, I pouted and looked at him through eyes bleary with sleep and wine.

And when I awoke, I was alone; he was gone. The bird had flown.
