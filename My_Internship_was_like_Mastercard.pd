I can't believe i wrote this.... Note: though what was written is truth, there are more to the nice side of things.
 
“Language is not simply a reporting device for experience but a defining framework for it,” Benjamin Whorf. Indeed, learning the Vietnamese language had been a great way to understand and immerse into the Vietnamese culture during my overseas internship. Working in a travel agency, I had the opportunity to travel around Southeast Asia for business purposes. I still can’t believe I used up half of my pages on the passport within that 8 months of internship.
 
No readings, essays or paper can aptly describe my experience in the travel industry; lonely planet can merely scratch the surface. Though I escaped a semester of linguisticky tribulation, I had to endure the toils of being a travel agent; conducting sales calls as I masquerade as a guest lecturer in Vietnam universities, representing the company in Singapore Tourism Board events across major cities in Vietnam, writing an article for Singapore Business Times, attending business meetings in Phuket, leading tour groups to alluring Angkor Wat, white-water rafting and cave -crawling in Perak, and much more... Unlike the dancing guy from the Visa card advertisement, my internship was more like Mastercard, “Priceless”.  Try it for yourself!
