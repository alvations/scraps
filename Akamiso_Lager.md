Yuzu saison, the refreshing end to a day of work. Sitting along the pathway alone in the petite bar table thinking about life and how half of it is almost gone.

What does it mean? Why am I here? Where do I go now? Questions stacked upon questions left unanswered. Here comes the yakitori. I am reminded of that stormy night on the streets of Ueno.

Then I was still young, braving the typhoon to go across the capsule hotel to get to the ramen shop because I was sick of eating omurice popping out of the vending machine. A bowl of kuroramen would calm my soul, at least that was what I thought. The layer of gleaming oil insulating the fatty pork stewed since 6am, soaking in the caramelised shoyu sauce. Or so I thought. Little did I know they had packed up for the evening to hide from the typhoon. As much as the twin brothers who own the ramen shop didn't want me to enter, they didn't bare to let me leave in that weather. True onotenashi. I was offered a share of their kushiyaki and a bottle from their private stash. Given my limited Japanese, I made it out to be Nagoya akamiso lager. I am pretty sure I got the Nagoya kanji right and the aka (red) and miso right too.

I guess my Chinese isn't as bad as what my Norman thought. Once I told him I watched a movie and him being a Malay who proudly speaks fluent mandarin questioned my statement, 'But 乐偭史 is a Chinese movie, you watched a Chinese movie? 真的吗?'

And thus the story ends as I gulp down the last mouthful of the saison... Akamiso larger.
