"[Are] you buying beer at 8am in the morning at the supermarket" the cashier asked as the point-of-sales system beeped thrice devouring the barcode with its infra-red beam. I could sense weird eyes rolling from the queue behind me as I was paying the for my Hoegaardens at the kasse.

I responded with a smile, "Visa paywave," ignoring the previous question.

"Young man, don't drink too much beer." She continued as she directed her palm to the money munching RFID machine that magically deducts binaries from my visa card.

"Das letzte Wiesn Wochenende ist angebrochen. Das ist meine letzte Chance, Frühschoppen zu trinken," I said in full führer accent.

"Ach so! O’zapft is!" she answered.

Giggling internally, I picked up my Belgium brew and I headed home. If only I could get my hands on a Troubadour Magma or even a Grimbergen Optimo Bruno.
