Pain is inevitable
====

*"Entrapped in a bottomless pit where suffering is inevitable. I need an outlet to expel the mental waste, I need an inlet to refill my physical strength. ceaseless worry about someone from afar, endless thoughts about being with her again. I am sick and tired of these, yet I have to endure."*

*"Struck with utter sadness, i gaze at the empty glass. it's neither half filled, nor half empty; it is empty, utterly empty. Yet it is the nothingness of the empty glass that captures my attention. the condensed water droplets clouds the glass; distracted from the cloud of droplets, the glass remained stoned, motionless."*asd
