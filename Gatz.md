My name is Michael, Michael Chang. I am a junior risk evaluator in Gatz Sun Corp, Inc., one of the world largest Chinese-owned multinational energy trading firm. I know the day is coming, something big is going to happen. A cataclysm, a calamity, a catastrophe.

----

As the gravel hits the block, the closing bell in the stock exchange ceased. I consider the post-closing scenery of Gatz office a wonder of the world. Joyous champagne, relieving sighs, desperate looks with unbutton collar and waywards ties. The triune display materializes regardless of whether the market closes higher or lower. There is always the winners, the evens and the losers in the cruelty of the exchange. The only variable is who fits into which clusters. As the great Gatz says, "You win some, you lose some".

Apparently, I will have no part to play in this game of numbers until my 6 months probation is over. For now, I am stuck in the mailing room. My daily excitement is the sauntering of the mirthful or depressed drunkards out of the office and I as the most junior of the junior executives have the responsibility to switch of the lights. The least I could do as an energy evangelist is to uphold Gatz's energy conservation effort.

As an office culture, I proceeded to The Bank Bar across the road for my weekload of unwinding. Ironically, we like to it the Bank, instead of the Bar. Technically no one goes to the bank handle transactions nowadays, we are spoilt with the comfort of bill payments and money transfers through the internet, believing that our hard-earned money is secured by the banks' cyber-security guards. The Bank is basically a Singaporean clone of the PJ Clarke pub in New York. One of those exclusive joint that my supervisors used to frequent during my internship at JP Morgan. Cigar scented leather sofa mixed with an air of phenolic scotch; mahogany bar furniture and bloody steaks that sucks the Darcula out of your wallet. The managers crowd around the premium leather sofas over aged scotch while the executives scattered around in cliqueky clusters on bar stools pounding beers and mixed nuts.

It is my 3 week at Gatz and my only companion was the person that orientated me to my office, the pantry and the Bank. He was supposedly the most junior junior executive until my arrival 2 days after I replaced his position, he left Gatz. I don't really remember his name nor his face and we seldom communicate beyond, "Where is this parcel supposed to go to?" and "Do I press double-sided, flip on long edge or flip on short edge?".

He is the average guy that you see in the financial sector, sharp feragamo suit, clark shoes and rimless spects. I shall call him Joe, until I remember his name. The only time we spoke beyond a 3 minutes exchange was at the Bank where he told me his work on the non-linearity of biofuel prices. I didn't bother to remember any thing he said after him telling about how we should power our buses with soyabean bio-diesel. I do however remember his last sentence to me as he boxed up his cubicle, "The coming is near". I wonder what it means. Some say he was headhunted by Petronas Energy Trading. Some say he gone bonkers and he substituted all the soyamilk with dairy milk in the pantry, sending a lactose intolerant manager to Singapore General Hospital.

"Scotch on the rock," I sit on the bar counter away from the clusters. Sometimes I wonder why aren't there any people outside of Gatz at the Bank on a Friday evening. I wonder, "Hmmm, the coming is near".

The Feds arrived. Nothing was ever right when the Federal Bankers arrived at the trading floor, "Gatz people out now." It was my third day as an energy evangelist after passing the series 7 exam, my 8th week at Gatz Sun Corporation, Inc.

I had heard the Enron tale before, I had seen countless remakes of Wall Street starring Michael Douglas as the protagonist, antagonist and anyothergonist that the script writes can think of. But that was my first time seeing it live.

10 seconds of silence proceeded as the Gatz people threw their trading notepads on the ground, walking towards the exit. Right after, the noise of the ceaseless bartering continued.

"Boys, and the fine hot lady at the back. Gatz's account is frozen and you can get back to your respective managers for further instructions," said the smartly suited Fed schmuck. I believe he's the leader of that entourage he brought. I wonder why did he need that men in black cortege to simply tell us to return to our managers and stop trading.

'Has this to do with the sempiternal paper shredding that the junior executives were doing for the past 2 days?' my first thought. I knew it. It's the balderdash about going paperless and into the cloud. I'm picturing Gatz Lightyear shouting "To infinity and beyond" as he flew to the clouds and hundred dollar bills fluttered out from his pocket load of misappropriated stash.

"Let's go to the Bank," said Thanh, one of the senior broker. He's a whiz on the floor. I heard he cleared 1000 lot of TTL (Tan Tay Tong Logistics Ltd) in a single day during the onset of the 1997 Asia financial crisis. Legend says he left Vietnam at age 16 to finish his PhD in quantum gravity. He should be with the big boys up in the 87th floor office but he came down to the trading floor today. We were told he was there to personally handle a discrete client.

Every movement from Thanh looks choreographed. It was as if he knew today would be D-day, as if he was wanting it to come. Even the mere lighting of the Marlboro stick exuded loftiness.

"Scotch, neat," the barista startled as he ordered his drink when he entered the Bank. It was 10am in the morning, I supposed the barista was expecting an espresso or sandwich. He sat alone at the bar top while the other boys bumped around the leather sofa. Something that we could never do when the top managers are around on our weekly friday drinking tradition.

Thanh snubbed the stick and took a sip from the glass. We watched him while engaging in senseless speculation of what's happening. Whenever he turns his head towards us, we looked away.

"Bang!" blood gushing out in every direction as torn flesh flew and landed. Thanh's arms holding the 6mm revolver fell off the bar top. I vividly remembered the next scene in slow motion. The headless corpse losing balance on the bar stool and crashing onto the floor as bloody tissues oozes out of the headless neck.

"What the hell just happened?" said someone on the table. Everyone else was too dazed to react.

"!@&*, !@&* NO," the barista sprouted expletives, "What the !@&* did he do? Do I call the police or should I call the ambulance?"
